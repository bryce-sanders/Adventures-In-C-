# Adventures-In-C++

## Overview

This project marks my very first venture into the use of the C++ programming language. In completing this project, I have the opportunity, not only to learn a very marketable and widely used programming language, but also to demonstrate that I can pick up the basics of new coding languages quickly.

This program stores student and staff information. It allows the user to enter the information of a new student or staff member and stores it in a vector. The program uses inheritance to create "Student" and "Staff" child classes from a "Person" parent class.

I am undertaking this project to help me to further my academic progress.

## Development Environment

This program was developed in Visual Studio Code

The program is written in C++ and makes special use of vectors

## Future Work

Things I would like to work on or add in the future:
* User entries will cause errors if they contain spaces. I would like to find the root cause of this and fix it in the future.
* The terminal looks messy with a bunch of white text on a black background. I would like to add color to the text in the future to make it more easily distinguishable.
* The classes I created are pretty bare-bones. I would like to add methods to the classes that I can call in the future.
